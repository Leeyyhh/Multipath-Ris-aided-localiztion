# Localization in Multipath Environments via Active Sensing with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces

This repository contains the code used in the paper "Localization in Multipath Environments via Active Sensing with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces," which proposes a method to tackle RIS-assisted localization in narrowband SISO systems, leveraging LSTM networks to enhance accuracy while reducing complexity.

The code is compatible with Google Colab for execution. Simply upload the code and data to Colab, and it can be run directly with minimal setup.
